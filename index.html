                So the crude term "the game of life" flowers
                and reveals a wider understanding of both life and games.
                Life as we tend to handle it, as a superposition of game-systems, could be thus seen as devoid of inherent meaning, as well as gaining some meaning where there was no meaning before. Depending on the games we choose to play or not play and those we are unaware of playing or not playing, our meaning for life is shaped and shifted by this complex multi-game-system which may include games (especially those we are unaware of playing but not only) with roles and rules that oppose each other. These conflicts if not [recognised] and properly handled could lead to extremely stressful states of mind 
                because our meaning is shattered.
